🔐 Just Completed: Fuzzing Portfolio Project

I built a custom mutation-based fuzzer that discovered a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in under 1 second!

🎯 Key Achievements:
- Developed custom fuzzer achieving 27,000 executions/second
- Discovered CWE-122 heap overflow with 100% reproducibility
- Identified exact 64-byte crash boundary
- Created working proof-of-concept exploit
- Documented findings in professional security advisory format

💻 Technical Stack:
Python, GCC, AddressSanitizer, GDB, Git

📊 Results:
✅ Time to discovery: < 1 second
✅ 6+ unique crash samples
✅ CVSS 8.6 (HIGH severity)
✅ Full root cause analysis with memory forensics
